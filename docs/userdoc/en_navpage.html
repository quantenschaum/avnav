    <p>This is the navigation view. In the middle there is the chart display
      with the boat position (red arrow). The yellow and green symbols are the
      AIS targets in vicinity (10nm, can be changed in settings) together with
      their current course as well as name or MMSI. The orange line indicates
      the course towards the current target waypoint. The dotted line show the
      original course from the start of navigation to the target waypoint. You
      can move and zoom the chart with the normal gestures. For zooming you can
      also use the buttons +/- on the right side.</p>
    <p>You can have up to 3 Navigation Circles being drawn around the boat to be
      able to estimate distances. You can change them via
      settings-&gt;navigation display. Standard values are 300m and 1000m.</p>
    <p>(since 202011xx) The length of the line indicating your current
      course&nbsp; ("Course Vector") can be adapted in the settings
      (Navigation/Boat Course Vector Length). You will set the seconds and the
      length will be computed using your current boat speed (default: 10
      minutes). The width of this line is controlled by the width for the
      Navigation Circles. </p>
    <p>The same settings also apply to the course vectors of AIS targets.</p>
    <p>For the boat direction and the course vectors you can select various
      modes (since 20220421) - you can choose at&nbsp; <a href="settingspage.html">settings</a>-&gt;navigation-&gt;boat
      direction (see the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/issues/200">GitHub</a>

    <p>In the settings you can additionally activate a "no boat movement"
      detection.(<a href="settingspage.html">settings</a>-&gt;navigation-&gt;zero
      SOG detect). If this is activated and the boat speed (SOG) drops below 0.2
      kn (<a href="settingspage.html">settings</a>-&gt;navigation-&gt;zero SOG
      detect below (kn)) the boat symbol will change to a red circle
      (boatImageSteady).</p>
    <h2>Lock Mode</h2>
    <p>If the chart is locked to the boat position (like in the picture) it will
      always keep the boat in the center of the screen and move the map
      accordingly.</p>
    Since version 20230614 you can allow (settings/Map "allow move when locked")
    to move the map when locked.<br>
    When you finish moving the map the boat will be held at the current position
    on the screen.<br>
    But it will be ensured that the boat at least is visible.<br>
    Since version 20210619 you can lock the boat position to any place on the
    screen even initially.&nbsp; You need to set (Settings/Map/boat lock mode)
    either "current" or "ask" .<br>
    <p>With "current" you will keep the boat at the point at the screen where it
      is when you "lock". <br>
      With "ask" there will be a dialog at every "Lock" :</p>

    <h2><a name="ais" id="ais"></a>AIS Target Display</h2>
    <p>AvNav shows AIS Targets up to a configured distance to the current vessel
      posiion.<br>
      The display includes some information about the target (configure it at
      the <a href="settingspage.html">settings page</a>, AIS) and some motion
      vectors that show the movement of the AIS target. </p>
    <p>AIS target symbols can be replaced by <a href="../hints/usericons.html">user
        defined symbols</a> - optionally different ones depending on the AIS
      shiptype. For the own boat and optionally for each AIS target a course
      vector points to the position to be reached within a defined time interval
      (default: 10 minutes).</p>
    <p>Since 20230614 AIS atons will also be displayed (you need to have <a href="settingspage.html">settings</a>/AIS
      "only show moving targets" switched off and "show other" switched on). For
      each AIS target you can display an estimated position depending on the age
      of the received information, course and speed (settings/AIS "show
      estimated position").<br>
      You can select if an AIS target should be rotated by its HDG (if received
      - settings/AIS "use heading for direction") - otherwise COG will be used.
      The course vector of an AIS target will always be rotated by COG.<br>
      There are different symbols for AIS targets - for details refer to "<a href="../hints/usericons.html">user
        defined icons</a>".<br>
      If you enable this in the setting the targets will also show an estimated
      position (shadow) based on the age of the AIS information.</p>
    <p>By clicking an AIS target (or the "next AIS" display) you will be shown
      all <a href="aisinfopage.html">information</a> for this target and you
      can change to the <a href="aispage.html">list of all AIS targets</a>.</p>
    <h3>AIS Motion Vectors</h3>
    <p>A basic introduction to the topic of true and relative motion vectors and
      how they are used in navigation can be found at</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://msi.nga.mil/Publications/RNMB">https://msi.nga.mil/Publications/RNMB</a>
        (page 59)</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YUic4LdWFg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YUic4LdWFg</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="true-motion-vectors">True motion vectors</h4>
    <p>AvNav displays the estimated track over ground for AIS targets if <a href="settingspage.html">settings</a>-&gt;AIS-&gt;use-course-vector
      is activated. A line is drawn from the last known position of the target
      in the direction of the course over ground (COG) of the target with the
      length of the course over ground (SOG) multiplied by
      boat-course-vector-length. This line is the so-called <em>true motion
        vector</em>, or TMV for short.</p>
    <p><img src="aisvectors-tmv.png" alt="true motion vectors" class="image"></p>
    <h4 id="relative-motion-vectors">Relative motion vectors (since 20240520)</h4>
    <p>In addition, <em>relative motion vectors</em> can be displayed in AvNav.
      To enable this, set a value greater than zero in <a href="settingspage.html">settings</a>-&gt;AIS-&gt;relative-motion-vector-range,
      then RMVs are also displayed as dashed lines for targets that are within
      this distance.</p>
    <p><img src="aisvectors-rmvp.png" alt="relative motion vectors" class="image"></p>
    <p>The RMV shows the movement of the target <em>relative</em> to the own
      ship, it results as the difference between TMV and the own course vector,
      so that TMV, RMV and the own course vector form a triangle. If the RMV of
      a target points directly at your own ship, there is a risk of collision.
      The position of the CPA can also be read directly from the RMV; the
      crossing of a line perpendicular to the RMV going through your own ship
      with the RMV.</p>
    <p>The RMVs correspond to the tracks that the targets would leave on a radar
      screen.</p>
    <h4 id="curved-vectors">Curved vectors (since 20240520)</h4>
    <p>If you activate <a href="settingspage.html">settings</a>-&gt;AIS-&gt;curved-vectors,
      a rate-of-turn (ROT) present in the AIS data is evaluated and the rotation
      of the target is taken into account when displaying the vectors. The TMVs
      and RMVs are then displayed as curved lines. The curved vectors may
      indicate a potential collision much earlier than the uncurved vectors.</p>
    <p><img src="aisvectors-curved.png" alt="curved vectors" class="image"></p>
    <h3>CPA and Motion Vector Computations</h3>
    <p>To compute the CPA data and the motion vectors AvNav considers the
      received data of an AIS target (position,COG,SOG, HDG) and the data of the
      own boat (position, COG, SOG).</p>
    <p>Before version 2025xxxx the computation uses the AIS target data as shown
      on the map and the boat data as shown when this data is computed.</p>
    <p>AvNav computes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the point where both tracks cross (our track and the target's track,
        ground tracks)</li>
      <li>the point, where both (we and target) reach minimum distance to each
        other, the CPA</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It also computes the times needed to reach these points. Negative times
      mean, that the point has already been passed.<br>
      Derived from this data we decide how we pass the target:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>front = we will cross track of target in front of target</li>
      <li>back = we will cross track of target astern of target</li>
      <li>pass = we have crossed the track of the target already or crossing
        point could not be calculated (stationary target)</li>
      <li>done = we have crossed the track and have passed CPA</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Based on the computed DCPA (minimal distance at the CPA point) and TCPA
      (time to reach this point) AvNav sets a warning flag at the target if the
      values are below the configured threshold.</p>
    <p>#TODO: priority</p>
    <p>The used computation approach has some drawbacks:</p>
    <p>The AIS target normally moves and AIS messages are only received at
      certain time intervals. Moreover the AvNav viewer part (in the browser)
      only fetches the AIS data every nn seconds (settings/UpdateTimes/AIS -
      default 5 seconds). So the AIS symbol on the map is drawn at a position it
      already had some time in the past. And the same way the computation will
      give results that are not completely correct - it uses the boat
      position/course/speed at the time of computation and the AIS
      position/course/speed from a time when the AIS message has been sent by
      the target.</p>
    <p>If you have a "classic" situation with some AIS target that you will
      approach in the near future you will observe a constant change in the
      computed CPA (and motion vector) data - even if the target keeps
      course/speed and your vessel also keeps course and speed.</p>
    <p>Starting from version 2025xxxx AvNav will give you the option (activated
      by default, settings/AIS/CPA from estimated) to compute the CPA and motion
      vector data from an estimated position of the AIS target. This position is
      the same as the one drawn on the map as a "shadow". The estimation simply
      assumes that the AIS target keeps course (COG) and speed over time and
      considers the age of the ais information.</p>
    <p>This age is computed by considering:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The time the AIS message has spent in the AvNav server from receiving
        it till the viewer (the browser) fetches the data. If the data is
        received by <a href="../hints/CanboatAndSignalk.html">SignalK</a>&nbsp;
        it also considers the time it already has spent in SignalK.</li>
      <li>The time from receiving it in the browser till the computation (could
        at most be the AIS update time - settings/UpdateTimes/AIS - 5s).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By using this computation you will normally get a constant CPA if your
      course/speed and the AIS target course/speed remain constant. So in most
      situation this could give you a better result.</p>
    <p>But there are still 2 problems that cannot be addressed with this
      computation:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the computation of the time between receiving the AIS message and
        sending it to the browser is wrong (e.g. missing time sync between
        SignalK and AvNav) you will always get wrong results. Potentially you
        will not really notice this if the difference remains the same over
        time.</li>
      <li>If the AIS target changes course/speed the estimated position is
        wrong. This normally should only be an intermediate problem that will go
        away once course and speed are stable again.<br>
        In principle we could also consider the ROT (rate of turn) of a target -
        but the ROT to be constant over longer time most probably is not very
        likely - so this is not used to compute the estimated position. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>As both computations have their limits AvNav leaves the decision to the
      user - defaulting to use the estimated position.</p>
    <h2>Displays (Widgets)</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    At the left side you have (top down):
    <ul>
      <li>current chart zoom, preferred zoom factor in brackets if auto zoom
        activated</li>
      <li>the closest AIS target (green), turning red on AIS warning or the
        selected AIS target (yellow)</li>
      <li>current time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The display of the closest AIS target will turn red if expected CPA is
      closer than 500m (can be changed in settings). If the display is yellow it
      does not show the nearest target but a different one selected on the <a href="aisinfopage.html">ais
        info page</a>. If you click on this display you move to the ais info
      page.</p>
    <p>(since 202011xx) The icons used for your boat and the AIS targets can be
      changed using a file <a href="../hints/usericons.html">images.json</a>.
      Additionally you can scale the AIS symbols (AIS/Icon Scale) and you can
      define a border(AIS/Border Width). You can also switch off AIS/AIS Use
      Course Vector, if your browser is too much slowed down by the computation
      and drawing of the AIS course vectors.</p>
    <p>The most important instrument data are shown at the bottom of the
      navigation page. At the left, data for currently active waypoint (if any)
      are displayed</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Position </li>
      <li>ETA </li>
      <li>Course</li>
      <li> Distance (nm) </li>

    <p>On the right the boat data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Course</li>
      <li> SOG (kn) </li>
      <li> Position </li>
      <li> local time from GPS </li>
      <li> GPS indicator: green - gps data ok, red: no gps data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Depending on display width and font size setting (widget font size) you
      will have 2 rows of data (you can change this in settings at "2 widget
      rows"). Items that do not fit anymore will be hidden completely.</p>
    <p>You can set up averaging (settings-&gt;navigation) for the boat data
      (position, course, speed). If turned on the captions at the displays will
      turn red.</p>
    <p>All display can be adapted with the <a href="../hints/layouts.html">layout

    <p>If a route is active there will be a display for the route data on the
      left side (name, remaining distance, ETA).</p>
    <p>In routing mode the next target waypoint will be activated automatically
      if the following conditions are met:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the boat is within the approach radius to the current target
        waypoint&nbsp; (default 200m - settings-&gt;route-&gt;approach)</li>
      <li>the second condition depending on the selected mode is met
        (early/90/late) - see&nbsp; <a href="../quickstart.html#nextwp">Next
          Waypoint Handling</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p> In approach to the waypoint the display of the route parameters will
      turn red and the course to the next waypoint will be shown additionally.
      Additionally a waypoint alarm is triggered.</p>
    <p>If next waypoint is not activated automatically (e.g. because you are too
      far), you can click on the waypoint data and use the <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/nextwp.svg"
        alt="" class="inlineimage"> button to set the next waypoint as target.</p>

    <h2>Special Functions</h2>
    <h3><a name="waypoint" id="waypoint"></a>Simple Waypoint Navigation</h3>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Unlock Chart (if on)</li>
      <li>Stop Nav</li>
      <li>Move chart until your target is below the center (cross), use zoom if
        necessary</li>
      <li>LockMarker (start navigation) </li>
      <li>Lock Chart</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Bearings</h3>
    <p>If a waypoint is active and the chart is not locked to the boat position
      you have a "Center" display at the left side. This shows the center
      position, the course and distance from the boat to the center and from the
      waypoint to the center. For a simple bearing just move the chart center
      (cross) to the bearing target and read the bearing from the "Center"
      display.</p>
    <h3>Feature Info</h3>
    <p>When clicking on the map a feature info dialog will pop up. Within this
      dialog you also have a button to immediately start a navigation to the
      clicked point.</p>
    <p>To start a route - change with&nbsp; <img src="../viewerimages/icons-new/route.svg"
